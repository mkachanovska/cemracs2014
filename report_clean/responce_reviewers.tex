\section{Extra Corrections}
As an extra improvement, not asked by the reviewers, we changed $\tilde{\omega}$ to $\omega_{\nu}$ in Section 2.

Corrected the definitions of $\alpha,\delta$ to comply with the definition of the cold plasma dielectric tensor of Stix (more precisely, removed terms $\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}$ in 
front of them)

\section{Responce to the reviewer #1}

All the corrections are marked in blue. 

A. General issues.

1. We agree with the remarks of the reviewer. We included a short introduction into the physics of the problem, 
which hopefully will facilitate in reading the article. The Section 4.3.1 contains of course a mistake in the description of the 
parameters of the problem. 

Concerning the notation: from now on $\epsilon^{\nu}_{\omega}(\mathbf{r})$ denotes the cold plasma dielectric tensor, similarly we denote its parameters. 


 We added explicitely dependence on space in parameters 
that depend on the spatial variables. 

- as mentionned above, in Lemma 2.1 it would be clearer to write "\omega \neq \omega_c" than "\hat \epsilon < + \infty"
(especially given that \hat \epsilon is not defined in Lemma 2.1).


We added as well a brief description of what limiting absorption and limiting amplitude principles
