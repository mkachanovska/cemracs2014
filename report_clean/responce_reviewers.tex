\section{Responce to the reviewer #1}

All the corrections are marked in blue. 

A. General issues.

1. We agree with the remarks of the reviewer. We included a short introduction into the physics of the problem, 
which hopefully will facilitate in reading the article. The Section 4.3.1 contains of course a mistake in the description of the 
parameters of the problem. 

- on page 3, the cold plasma dielectric tensor seems to be primarily a function of \omega the antenna frequency. But afterwards
one realizes that it is also a function of x, and that this dependence is critical in the problems under consideration. That should
be stressed at the beginning of Section 2. And maybe alpha should be introduced as a function of x (as is done in Remark 2.2),
with omega a parameter.

- using "epsilon_0" to denote a non-uniform dielectric tensor does not help readability... Do the authors really expect the readers 
to understand that the letter "epsilon_0" in  Problem (5) represents a non-uniform tensor which variations are the cause of singular
solutions ?

- as mentionned above, in Lemma 2.1 it would be clearer to write "\omega \neq \omega_c" than "\hat \epsilon < + \infty"
(especially given that \hat \epsilon is not defined in Lemma 2.1).
