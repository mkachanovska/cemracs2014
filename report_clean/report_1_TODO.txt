This article presents several numerical schemes for a linear model describing the interaction between an EM wave emitted by a 
plane antenna and a plasma in the presence of a strong external magnetic field. Here the geometry is essentially 1d (dy = dz = 0) 
and the considered EM wave is in X-mode (E = (Ex, Ey, 0), H = (0, 0, Hz)). 

The main purpose of the article is to compare the behavior of the numerical solutions in the frequency domain and in the time 
domain, especially when a hybrid resonance phenomenon shows up in the plasma. This is of practical interest for plasma heating applications. 
Because the exact field can be singular it is not clear whether frequency-domain solutions should match with time-domain solutions
as time goes to infinity, so this study is of interest and I think it deserves to be published. 

However, I do not recommend a publication in its present state. To do so I need that the authors improve the presentation.
Here are some suggestions in this direction.


A. General issues.

1. The physics of the problem is hardly described, which makes the article quite obscure for non-experts. 
After reading Section 4.1.2 one gets the feeling that the presence of a hybrid resonance is related to the fact that alpha may vanish, 
but in Section 4.3.1 (entitled "No-Resonance case") the same profile is considered for alpha, which is puzzling. 

Therefore I encourage the authors to explain clearly in Section 1 which values of the parameters correspond to a hybrid resonance,
and briefly give a hint on why the resulting solutions are expected to be singular. Also they should make it very clear that the obvious
case of ill-posedness in Problem (5), namely omega = omega_c, is not considered here. This is said in Lemma 2.1 but in technical terms.

In addition to a clearer introduction to hybrid resonance, the authors should improve the choice of notations in Section 2:

- on page 3, the cold plasma dielectric tensor seems to be primarily a function of \omega the antenna frequency. But afterwards
one realizes that it is also a function of x, and that this dependence is critical in the problems under consideration. That should
be stressed at the beginning of Section 2. And maybe alpha should be introduced as a function of x (as is done in Remark 2.2),
with omega a parameter.

- using "epsilon_0" to denote a non-uniform dielectric tensor does not help readability... Do the authors really expect the readers 
to understand that the letter "epsilon_0" in  Problem (5) represents a non-uniform tensor which variations are the cause of singular
solutions ?

- as mentionned above, in Lemma 2.1 it would be clearer to write "\omega \neq \omega_c" than "\hat \epsilon < + \infty"
(especially given that \hat \epsilon is not defined in Lemma 2.1).

Also, it would be nice if the limiting amplitude and absorption principles could be recalled in a few words to go along Figure 1.


2. The reduction to a 1d problem is not clearly justified. System (1) is introduced as if it could be infered from the choice
of a particular coordinate system, but I am guessing a few more assumptions here such as \partial_y = 0. 

Also, when describing the contents of the article in the introduction, writing "we again investigate this problem in one dimension"
is quite misleading since the whole paper is about the 1d case (unless I missed something).


B. Specific remarks.

- p2 on top:
  in several places in the paper it seems that negative values of the friction coeficient \nu can be considered, see for instance
  Lemma 2.1 or p.9 after (15). This is strange for a friction coeficient, and should be better explained. Or \nu should be simply 
  introduced as a non-negative coefficient.
  
- p2 after (1)
  * what is "L" ? (why consider starting at -L and not 0?)
  * what is the energy of the system when $\nu \neq 0$?

- p3 above (3)
  there are some problems in the computed tensors: a coeficient (\omega/c)^2 may be missing in \tilde delta,
  and I don't believe it should be present in (3).
  
- p3 in equation (4)
  I really think epsilon_0 should be avoided here. I suggest denoting \tilde epsilon the tensor with nu \neq 0 and epsilon the tensor 
  with nu = 0, consistent with alpha and delta ?
  Also, the latex notation \varepsilon should be used here, and not \epsilon since it is used later to denote an error bound, see (15).
  


- p4 Equation (5)
  why write i without a dot?

- p4 Equation (8)
  since u is the speed, maybe take another letter for the electric field? (what is wrong with E?) -- see also Remark 2.2

- p4 in Lemma 2.1
  is alpha_nu related to special values of alpha? I don't think so, but the notation suggests that it is.
  
- p5 after (10)
  V_Ex and V_Ey are not function spaces
  
  
- p6 two lines before the discrete system
  "Ex"
  
- p8 3 lines from top of Section 4
  "the code written in Octave":  which code?
  
- p8 before Section 4.1  
  I don't think the authors mean Section 2.2
    
- p8, Equation (12)
  the authords may add that nu = 0 here, and explain in one line why these parameters are chosen
  
- p8, Equation (13)
  \rm fonts should be used for the Airy function, or something like \DeclareMathOperator{\Ai}{Ai}
  And while we are there, reminding the Airy equation could be useful.
  
- p8, last line
  When citing a book (here [2]), pointing to a specific Section or result is helpful. Also, what is the smoothness 
  of Ex, Ey for the chosen parameters?
  
- p9 Figure 3
  For this figure and the other as well, the captions should be more informative. For instance, it is not 
  clear which problem is referred to here. The boundary condition (22) varies with time, but the figure appears 
  in the middle of Section 4.1 which is devoted to the frequency-domain problem.  

  Also, E^c_x and E^c_y are mentionned but not defined. 
  
- p9 on top
  The title of Section 4.1.2 is pointless, the whole paper being about the X-mode problem.

- p9 Equation (15)  
  E^{\nu,h} is used here, but E^{h,\nu} is used in (16). And in (16) E^\nu becomes E...

- p9 after (17)
  I guess the authors mean L^2 instead of H^2

- p10 before and after Table 1
  why dropping the exponents nu in the E field now?
  
  
- p11 Figure 5
  in the caption E^\nu now denotes the computed solution. Before that was the exact solution, see eg (17)
  
- p12 Figure 6
  * why an isolated "h" on top? why a line between the two rows of plots?  
  * x starts at 0, why not at -L?
  * which part of complex field E are shown?
  * again it is not clear what is the meaning of the \nu exponent in the E^\nu_x, and its absence in E_y...
  * what is T compared to omega ?
  
- p12 Section 4.3
  The authors should (very briefly) recall what are the limiting amplitude and absorbtion principles
  
- p12 Section 4.3.1
  I am glad that Ne > 0 since this is a density, but I am not sure to better understand the physics here.
  In this "no-resonance case" the authors take alpha(x) = 1-Ne(x) = -x. Wasn't this a typical profile
  for the resonant case, as indicated in Section 4.1.2 ?
  
- p12 Equation (23)
  the notation \mathcal E was used for the energy above in the text.
  
- p14 Figures 8 and 9
  which problems are illustrated here?   
  
- p15 in Conclusion
  "piecewise-constant FEM" -> not P1 ?
